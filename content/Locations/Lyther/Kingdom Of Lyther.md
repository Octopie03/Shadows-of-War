## Culture
$\quad$ The people of Lyther come from all over. They are accepting and excited about cultural differences. New traditions and foods are often celebrated. Immigrants are automatically accepted as Lytherian, so long as they want to be named as Lytherians. Immigrants who are still loyal to their home countries are not nearly as accepted and tend to be unfavorable. This unfortunate characteristic of Lytherians has been multiplied due to the recent war. 
## History
$\quad$ Czitol has been ruling over Lyther for the past 500 years.
