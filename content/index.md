## You! 
Hello!!! Welcome to Kunarona, the world in which you live. The Great Wars have been raging on for the last two years! You've been a soldier fighting for the Kingdom of Lyther. Recently, you've gotten a message from the King himself, Czitol. He's said that you've been recruited into a specialized squad of elite soldiers, to be working directly under his orders to help end these wars once and for all. You are to meet him at the castle tonight!
